## Images

Within CSS you are able to control the size of an image, when you use the width and height properties. When you specify the image sizes, it helps the pages to load more smoothly, because the HTML and CSS code will usually load before the images, so letting the browser know how much space to leave for an image enables it to render the rest of the page, without waiting for the image to download. The background image property enables you to put an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. The background image will repeat to fill the entire box, by default. 

body {
	background - image: url (“images/pattern.gif”);}

The background repeat property can have four values: 
**- repeat** in which the background is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
**- repeat x** in which the image is repeated horizontally.
** - repeat y** in which the image is repeated vertically.
** - no repeat** in which the image is only shown once.
**- fixed** in which the background image on the page stays in the same position.
** - scroll** the background image moves up and down, when the user scrolls up and down. 

Within CSS it’s possible to use a **rollover,** which is when you create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it. Also you can use a **sprite,** which is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. *(Duckett, Jon, HTML & CSS: design and build websites, pp. 406-427 2011.)*

## Practical Information

It would be in your best interest after you’ve completed launching your webpage to look into **search engine optimization.** Search engine optimization is the practice of trying to make your website appear at or near the top of the list of search engine results, when people search for websites that are related to the topic of your website. The best way to approach this is to research key words that people type into a search engine, when they are looking for a website that has the same topic and subject matter as your website, and to include those keywords into the text of your HTML code, in order to let the search engine know that your website covers these topics and subject matters. Another good technique or approach to use along with this is to get other websites to link to your website. Doing this will help search engines determine how high to rank your website in the search results. The more websites that link to your website, the higher your website will be in the results. You may want to consider using a free service called *Google Analytics.* Google analytics gives you a piece of tracking code, which you should put on every page of your website. This enables you to see how visitors use your site. Before you put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting. Your domain name is your web address. Keep in mind that millions of domain names have already been registered. In some case, somebody may have already registered their website under the same domain name that you would have initially wanted for your website,  so it may take you a while to come up with a domain name that is the right fit for your website. In order for other people to see your website, you will have to upload it to a **web server,** which are special computers that are always connected to the internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested. *(Duckett, Jon, HTML & CSS: design and build websites, pp. 476-492 2011.)*
