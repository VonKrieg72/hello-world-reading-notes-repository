# Learning Markdown

## Markdown 

Markdown is a computer language (syntax) that enables you to write word documents on the web. It's a way to style text on the web. However, it has it's own syntax and symbols, which enable you to stylize the words in the document with many features. If you wish to write a word document, the first thing many people will do is put a header. 

Markdown has many headers and subheaders in its syntax, and you can choose up to six different sizes for the main header and subheaders. One (#) symbol being the biggest and six (#) symbols being the smallest. Make sure you leave a space between the symbols and the text in order for it to display properly in the document. Other special features you can do will be displaying the text in either *italic* or **bold.** For italic text, type either one * symbol or one _ symbol before and after the text, and with bold you would type two * symbols or two _ symbols before and after the text with no spaces between the symbols and the text. 

For ordered lists, type the number with a period, then space and type the list item. Press enter to go to the next line for the next list item. For sublists within a list just indent further in. To post images in your document, you first type an exclimation point (!) and in brackets next to the exclamation point, you put the text of what the image is, and then next to that in paranthesis, you type the URL. If you wish to post links to other websites, just put the website address in paranthesis, and it will become a link. If you want to do blackquotes, you type a colon (:) then skip a space to the next line, and put the (>) symbol before the quote.

As you can see, Markdown has many features that can help you stylize the words in your document, to make it look professional. 


## Github Pages

Github pages is a cool feature, that allows you to turn your repositories (a place where you put all your projects) into websites. This feature is very cool and useful, because it allows your to display documents, portfoliios, and projects. This will be very useful when trying to get a job in the software field. The coolest part abot Github pages is you don't have to know to to code, set up servers or configure databases to create these. Github is a straight forward path to creating a website for you and your projects.

Github serves all of your projects, documents and portfolios from a personal URL that's attached to your username or organizations you are with. Github looks for the web content for your project on a special branch, and for the sites attached to an existing repository. This branch is kept seperate from your code. However, if you wish to create a site for you or your organization, you can do so by creating a repository, with your Github page URL as its name, and add web content to its master branch. If you wish to build something that's more like a blog or document showcase, you can publish them with the help of Jekyll, which is an open source tool, that can transform your plain text files into websites. Also, keep in mind, because your files are part of a Github repository, you can maintain them using the same tools you already use on Github. 

Think of Github as a place where you build and create things, and Github pages is a place where you share what you've built. 


## Github Markdown Syntax

The Github Markdown syntax has some additional features on it that's unique to Github, that will assist you in making your word documents and files more presentable. 

You can mention people and teams on Github in your files or word documents, by simply typing an @ symbol plus their username or team name. This triggers a notification to bring their attention to the conversation. The people or teams you mention will also receive notifications, when you mention them, which makes communication between groups and people easier. There is an autocomplete feature for people or teams you collaborated with on the thread, when you type the @ symbol, which makes a list pop up for you to choose the name or group from. 

Uploading assets to Github such as images is as easy as dragging & dropping or posting it. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments and .md files in your repository. If you want to add emojies just type a : which will bring up a list of suggested emojis. This list will filter as you type. Once you see the one you want, press tab or eneter to complete the highlighted result.

For lunch today üç£, ü•©, üç§, üçï, & üåÆ will be served in the cafeteria.

Markdown on Github has alot of cool features, that can help you make your files more presentable and more professional. It is definitely worth it to learn and get familiar with it.
