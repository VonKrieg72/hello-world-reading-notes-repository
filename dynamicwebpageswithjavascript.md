# Dynamic-Web-Pages-With-JavaScript

## JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a language used in programming that enables you to put into place sophisticated things on web pages. For example, whenever a web page does sophisticated or complicated things such as showing timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics or scrolling video jukeboxes, as opposed to just sitting there and displaying static information, chances are JavaScript has some involvement. *(Mozilla and individual contributors, “JavaScript-Dynamic client-sided scripting”, 2005-2021)*

JavaScript is well known as the scripting language for web pages. However, many non browser environments such as [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org), and [Adobe Acrobat](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/) use it as well. The style of programming that JavaScript uses is a [prototype-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prototype-based_programming), multi-paradigmed, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative. *(Mozilla and individual contributors, “JavaScript”, 2005-2021)*

The criterions for JavaScript are the [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)(ECMA-262) and the [ECMAScript Internationalization API specification](https://tc39.es/ecma402/) (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation during MDN is based on the most recent draft rendition of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. Keep in mind that JavaScript is not to be confused with Java programming language. They are both trademarked by the same company; however, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics and use.  *(Mozilla and individual contributors, “JavaScript”, 2005-2021)*

## Input and Output in JS

< html>

< head>
  
  < title>Hello World</title>

< /head>

< body>
 
First name: <input id="first_name">
Last name: <input id="last_name">
<button id="say">Say hi!</button>
 
< hr>

< div id="result"></div>
 
< script>

function say_hi() {
    var fname = document.getElementById('first_name').value;
    var lname = document.getElementById('last_name').value;
 
    var html = 'Hello <b>' + fname + '</b> ' + lname;
 
    document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = html;
}
 
document.getElementById('say').addEventListener('click', say_hi);
</script>
 
< /body>

< /html>

*(Szabo, Gabor,”Input Output in plain JavaScript, 2015 MAR 31)*

In the above example, the JS code has a function called **say_hi**. It utilized the **getElementByld** to find the DOM element portraying the input element with the id **first_name.** The object reply has a method **value** that will bring back the text the user has typed in that field. This method is utilized to get the content of both **input** fields and give their content to two variables: **fname** and **Iname.** Afterwards, these variables are used to create an HTML snippet and give it to a new variable called **html.** Then the **innerHTML** attribute is set as *earlier* to show the HTML that is created.

*(Szabo, Gabor,”Input Output in plain JavaScript, 2015 MAR 31)*

## JavaScript Variables

There are three ways to declare a JavaScript variable:


-Using var

-Using let

-Using const

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

Variables are receptacles for storing data (values). In the following example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

var x = 5;

var y = 6;

var z = x + y;

So, in this example, you can expect that:

-x stores the value of 5

-y stores the value of 6

-z stores the value of 11

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

In the next example, we have price1, price2, and total, as variables

var price1 = 5;

var price2 = 6;

var total = price1 + price2;

As previously mentioned, since variables store date (values) the total = price1 + price2, which would be 11. 

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

### JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be concise names, like x and z or more descriptive names, such as age, sum, and totalVolume. There are basic rules for creating and building names for variables (unique identifiers):

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

-Names can have letters, underscores, digits, and dollar signs.

-Names have to begin with a letter

-Names also have the ability to  begin with $ and _

-Names are case sensitive (so y and Y are different variables)

-You are not able to use reserved words (like JS keywords) as names.

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

### The Assignment Operator

In JavaScript the equal sign (=) is an assignment operator not an equal to operator. For example, x = x + 5 can be assigned to x; therefore the value of x would be incremented by 5. In the event you wish to write the equal to operator in JS language, you would write it as (==).

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

### Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables

Creating a variable in JavaScript is known as declaring a variable. JavaScript variables are declared by using the var keyboard: 

var carName;

After the declaration, the variable doesn’t have a value (or has the variable of undefined in JS). So, in order to assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign.

carName = "Volvo";   

or you can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it

var carName = "Volvo";

In the next example, a variable called carName was created and the value of "Volvo" was assigned to it. Then the value was "output" inside an HTML paragraph with id = "demo"

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

  var carName = "Volvo";

  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName; 

</script>

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

### Value = undefined

Most of the time in computer programs, variables are declared without a value. In JavaScript a variable will have the value of undefined, if it is declared without a value. In this example, after the execution of the statement, the variable carName will have the value of undefined.

var carName;

However, in JavaScript you can **Re-Declare** a variable, and it will not lose its value. In this example, after the execution of the statement, the variable carName will still have the value "Volvo.”

var carName = "Volvo";

var carName;

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

### JavaScript Dollar Sign $

It's important to keep in mind that JavaScript identifiers (names) have to begin with:

-A letter (a-z)

-A dollar sign ($)

-Or an underscore (_)

Identifiers containing $ are valid variable names, because JavaScript treats this sign as a letter

var $$$ = "Hello World";

var $ = 2;

var $myMoney = 5;

Use of the $ in JavaScript does not occur frequently; however, in the JavaScript library jQuery, the main function $ is used to pick HTML elements. In jQuery $("p") means pick all p elements.

*(Refsnes Data, “JavaScript Variables”, 1999-2021)*

### JavaScript Underscore (_)

Since underscores in JavaScript are treated as letters, the identifiers that contain one are valid variable names. For example,

var _lastName = "Johnson";

var _x = 2;

var _100 = 5;
