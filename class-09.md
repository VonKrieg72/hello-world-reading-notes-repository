# Forms and JavaScript Events

## Forms

Within HTML,  a form is an element, which enables you to gather information from visitors on your site. The most well known and commonly used form on the web is the search box. In particular the search box on google’s home page. Forms also enable users to do other functions on the web, such as registering as a member to a website, shopping online, and signing up newsletters or mailing lists. On your HTML document, all form controls will be within the **< form >** element, which should always have the **action** attribute, and usually carry the **method** and **id** attribute as well. The value of the action attribute is the URL for the page on the server that will receiver the information in the form when it’s submitted. There are two types of methods: get or post. When the get method is used, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL that’s specified in the action attribute. Use the get method for short forms and when you’re getting data from the web server. The post method sends the values in the http headers. Use the post method in your forms when the form enables users to upload a file, is very long, contains sensitive data, and adds information to or deletes information from a database. The value of the id attribute is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page. *(Duckett, Jon, HTML & CSS: design and build websites, pp. 44-175 2011.)*

## Lists, Tables & Forms

The list style type property will enable the user to control the shape or style of a bullet point, which is also commonly referred to as a **marker.** It can be used on the **< ol > < ul > and < li >** elements. For unordered lists, the bullet points can be either disc, circle, square, or no bullet point. For ordered lists, the user can use either numbers, letters or roman numerals. If you wish to use an image to act as a bullet point, you can do so with the list style image property. The value begins with the letters url and then a pair of parenthesis. Within the parenthesis, the path to the image is given inside double quotation marks. When you are setting up your table, there are a couple CSS properties that will assist you in setting it up. They are the width, padding, text-transform, letter-spacing, font size, border-top, border-bottom, text-align, background color, and hover. CSS is most commonly used in order to control the appearance of the form elements. *(Duckett, Jon, HTML & CSS: design and build websites, pp. 330-357 2011.)*


## Events

Event handling is when the user interacts with the HTML using three steps, which gets it to trigger some JavaScript code. The first thing you have to do is select the element nodes that you want the script to respond to. The second step is to indicate which event on the nodes you selected will trigger the response. Programmers refer to this as binding an event to a DOM node. The third step is to state the code you want to run when the event occurs. Whenever the event occurs on a specified element it will trigger a function. There are also three ways to bind an element. The event handlers will allow you to indicate which event you are waiting for on any particular element. There are three types of event handlers. The first is the HTML Event handler. It’s important to note that this is bad practice, however, you have to know about it, because you may come across it in older code. In earlier versions of HTML, a set of attributes were included that could respond to events on the elements that they were added to. Traditional DOM Event Handlers were introduced in the original DOM specification. They enable you to separate the JavaScript from the HTML, so they are considered to be better than HTML event handlers. DOM Level 2 Event Listeners were an introduction in an update to the DOM specification in DOM Level 2, which was released in 2000. They are now the most preferred way to handle events. *(Duckett, Jon, JavaScript & JQuery: Interactive front end web development, pp. 243-292, 2014.)*
