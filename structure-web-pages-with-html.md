## An Introduction to Wireframing

### What is a Wireframe

Wireframing is a drawing of a web page used by UX designers, which enables them to define, and plan out a basic or rough sketch of a website, app or product, and the information ordering of their design. Before anything is built using code, you have to know where all the information is going to go, and how users are going to interact with your interface, through where you decide to position things, such as buttons, menus, pictures, and links on the diagrams. Wireframing enables you to design the layout and interaction of your interface, without the over burden of colors, typeface choices, or text. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

### Wireframe Examples

How you design your wireframe is up to you, whether you decide to draw it by hand with pen and paper, or whether you decide to use software on your computer. So, before you actually begin drawing out or designing your own wireframe, it's a good idea to take a look at some wireframe examples, doing so will give you some ideas and encouragement for your own wireframes, the many variety of ways to create them, and which method you are the most comfortable with. However, beginners should keep in mind that, when designing a wireframe by drawing on paper or on a board, you have the advantage of being able to make changes more easily, and you'll pay more attention to detail later on when you switch to software. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

### Things to Consider Before You Start Wireframing

UX designers go about their wireframing in a variety ways. Whether the decision is made to draw it by hand, or use online apps or tools, it's going to be more based on what plan the specific situation requires, as opposed to the choice of how the UX designer would like to design the wireframe is. What the situation requires is going to depend on how much attention there is on the looks of the project, and how much is still unknown in regards to what's being designed. If the task is little and the visual design has been either decided upon or is not that important, then it's fine to go from sketch to code. However, if the time, resources and business value are all high, then it's a good idea to make a high quality and high definition wireframe, and put it through a cycle of testing, before getting your final product. 

### The Best Tool for Wireframing

In the event that you want to try out some wireframe tools online, there are a few selections worth checking out.

## Six Steps to Make a Wireframe

### Do Your Research

It's important to keep in mind that UX Design is a process, and wireframing will not be the first thing you do in the process, so before you start drawing out your wireframe by hand, it's important to have these two steps covered first: *having a deep understanding of who your audience is by conducting research, detailing requirements, creating user personas, and defining use cases, also you would want to compliment this by conducting more industry and competitor research.* To briefly explain what this means, it means looking at and doing a deep analysis of product lines, that are similar to what you're trying to create, looking deeper into prevailing UX trends and best practices, and reviewing you own internal design guidelines. In the event that you happen to be designing a new feature, It would be a good idea to do some research outside of your domain, such as looking at other apps and getting some creative ideas from different fields of expertise, and where they intersect with yours. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

## Prepare Your Research for Quick Reference

During the course of your research, you are going to come across a lot of information, some of it is going to be useful and some of it will not be useful, and you're not going to be able to retain all of it. So, it would be a good idea to come up with a quick reference guide or a cheat sheet, with your business and user goals, your personas, use cases, and some of the most interesting  features you came across in your competitor's research. Also, keep in mind a little constructive criticism from your audience, which will help you focus your attention on user experience, which is never forget what you're designing. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

### Make Sure You Have Your User Flow Mapped Out

It's very important to have an idea of how many screens you'll need to produce, and if your website design is too complex for the user to navigate through; otherwise, your wireframing is going to get very sloppy and unorganized very quickly. It's also important to have a very firm concept of what field or background your users come from, and where it's necessary for them to end up. Being well versed in UX Vocabulary, will familiarize you with terms such as user flows and information architecture. Good informational bulding blocks will see to it that your users are self sufficient (they won't call customer service with questions about something that is very simple), less frustration with your product (this will build trust and a good relationship), and a lower level of drop off and drop out. This will mean more business and more revenue for you. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

### Draft, Don't Draw. Sketch, Don't Illustrate

At this point, after completing the previous steps, you can now start putting your ideas down on paper. It's important to mention that you shouldn't worry about colors or aesthetics, leave it to your UI designer to deal with that, or if you happen to be the designer as well, then just leave that task for later. At this point, you are making a blue print and representing what the final product will have and formats, not drawing or sketching in precise detail. It would be a good idea, to sketch your ideas down with a marker pen or a sharpie, because it prevents you from focusing too much on detail. As you are sketching down your ideas, ask yourself these three questions:

-How can you arrange the content to back up your user's goals

-Which information should be the most eye-catching or flamboyant? Where should your most important message be located on the site? What is going to be the first thing the users see when they go to your website?

-What will the users anticipate to see on specific sections or areas of the page?

-Which selection of tabs or buttons are necessary for the user to complete the wanted action? *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

### Add Some Detail and Get Testing

At this point, your next step in the process would be to add some details from your          blueprint to your wireframe for its upgrade, and get it to prototype mode. Your wireframe is still a skeleton at this point, so you want to start adding detail to it, and start building it up. Keep the following things in mind:

**-Usability** Conventions are things such as navigation bars, search boxes, etc. You want to figure out where on your web page you're going to place these things. 

-You want your wording or instructions to be simple and not overly complex for calls to action.

**-Trust building elements:** What is necessary in order for you to gain the trust of your customers, and where would you place these elements.

-Tooltips that let you know any functionality, which could be encased in a prototype transition.

At this point you are ready to start conducting user tests, which in most cases will be your own colleagues. Some tools that you can utilize during this testing period are **Usability Hub** to choose test screens and gather up  qualitative feedback, as well as **Prott**, which you can use to test and examine the comprehension of the basic user traffic to your site. With Prott, you can also take a picture and upload your hand drawn wireframes, and then attach them to user button overlays. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

**Start Turning Your Wireframes into Prototypes**

Once you've analyzed all of your feedback from your first prototype, you can start building up your high fidelity prototype. During this phase you can utilize tools such as **Proto io, Adobe XD, Framer, Sketch, and Figma.** Sketch and Figma are the most well known, So, once you've drawn out, or sketched your wireframes, you can import them into **InVision,** which is an industry leading prototype tool. In the InVision tool you'll be able to interlink your screens for another round of high fidelity user testing. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

## How to Make Your Wireframe Good: Three Key Principals

### Clarity 

Your wireframe should answer the following questions: What the site page is, What various features are at the disposal of your user to navigate on your site, Does your wireframe satisfy their needs. 

### Confidence

You want to make sure that your site page is easy enough to navigate and understand, by the users. If your site page design is inconsistent, uncertain, or has buttons or boxes in abrupt or unforseen places, user confidence in your design will decline. Ensuring that your site page is easy to navigate and clear calls to action options are available will accelerate user confidence in your brand. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

### Simplicity is Key

You want your users to be able to navigate their way through your site page design, with as little fancy stuff as possible. Having too much content, copy, or links can bewilder or confuse the user, and this will have a negative affect on your user's ability to accomplish  their goals with their website. *(Allabarton, Rosie 2021, The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe.)*

## HTML Basics

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the language or code that is used to define the structure of your content. HTML is composed of elements, which are used to close in or wrap around the content in order to make it look a particular way. For any written text, sentences or paragraphs that you would like to appear by themselves, you would enclose that text, or wrap that text in an opening and closing tag. For example, if you wanted to write the following sentence: *My rabbit is very apprehensive,* and make it stand by itself, you would write it in html as:

<p> My rabbit is very apprehensive </p>

(Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)

### Anatomy of an HTML Element

An HTML element made up of

**-Opening Tag**- This is made up of the name of the element (p in the above example) enclosed in an opening and closing angle brackets. This tells you where the element starts or where it begins to effect the text it is wrapped around. 

**-Closing Tag**- This is similar to the opening tag except this one has a forward slash, that coms before the element name. This tells you where the element ends. *(Its important to make sure that you don't forget to use the closing tag, or you may get unexpected results)*

**-The Content**- The words, sentences, or paragraphs of the element.

**-The Element**- The opening tag, closing tag, and content all combine together to form the element.

**-Attributes**- This contains additonal information about the element that you would not like to be displayed in the actual content. 

(Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)

### Nesting Elements

When you put an element inside of another element, it is called nesting. In the above example if you wanted to bring attention to the fact that your rabbit is **very** apprehensive, you would wrap the word very in a **<strong>** element, to strongly emphasize the word.
  
  <p> My rabbit is <strong>very</strong> apprehensive. </p>

  (Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)
  
  ### Empty Elements
  
  Elements which have no content and are known as **Empty Elements.** Image elements don't need to wrap around content to affect it. For example:
  
  <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
  
  As you can see in the image element there is no </img> at the end to close out the element.

  (Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)
  
  ### Anatomy of an HTML Document
  
  In HTML individual elements will combine to form an entire HTML page.
  
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
  </body>
</html>

(Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)

**<!DOCTYPE html>**- This doesn't do much. It's just needed to make sure the document behaves correctly.

**<html></html>**- Sometimes referred to as the root element, This element encloses all the content on the entire page.

**<head></head>**- This element acts as a place to store all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to display in search results.

**<meta charset="utf-8">**- This element sets the mood or personality of your document should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the majority of written languages. It would be a good idea to set this, in order to help avoid some issues or problems later on. 

**<title></title>**- This element establishes the title of your page, which is the title that you will see in the browser tab, the page is loaded in. 

**<body></body>**- This is comprised of all the content that you would like to be displayed to web users when they visit your page. 

(Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)

### Images

This element implants an image into your page in the position it appears. It does this through the src (source) attribute, which has the path to our image.

<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

(Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)

It's important to keep in mind that image elements don't have </img> to close it out.

### Links

<a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a>

<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>

(Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "HTML Basics", 2005-2021)

If you want to create a link in HTML, You would first wrap the text in <a></a>. Then you would give <a> element an href attribute. Then you would fill in the value of the attribute with the web address, that you want the link to link to. Make sure you include https or http or you might get un-expected results.

  ## Semantics
  
  Semantics in coding refers to the meaning of a piece of code, such as what effect running that line of JavaScript have? or what purpose or role does that HTML element have?

  (Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "Semantics", 2005-2021)
  
  ### Semantics in JavaScript
  
  In JavaScript, take the time to look at and ponder a function that goes with a string parameter, and puts back an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would it be necessary to look at the code to be able to comprehend  what the function did if it was called build ('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')

  (Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "Semantics", 2005-2021)
  
  ### Semantics in CSS
  
  In CSS, you should be open to the possibility of styling a list with li elements representing the many types of fruits. Would you have knowledge of what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

  (Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "Semantics", 2005-2021)
  
  ### Semantics in HTML
  
  To use an example, the < h1 > element In HTML is a semantic element, which gives the text it surrounds the role of a high level heading on your page. 
  
  (Mozilla and Individual Contributors, "Semantics", 2005-2021)
  
  ## HTML: HyperText Markup Language
  
  **HTML** is the most basic building block of the web. HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other languages besides HTML, such as CSS and JavaScript are used generally to describe a web page's appearance/presentation or functionality/behavior.
