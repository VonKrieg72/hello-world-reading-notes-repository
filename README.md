## About Me

Hi. Welcome to my reading notes repository.  My name is David Stokes. I am a student at Code Fellows. I am originally from NJ but currently live in PA. I look forward to a career in software development and coding. So, far the journey with Code Fellows has been challenging, but worth it, when you see the new things that you create. In my spare time, I am currently self-studying a foreign language. I am not conversational yet, but I feel I am very close, I just have to keep at it and not give up.
