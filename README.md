This is my reading notes repository with Code Fellows

## About Me

Hi. Welcome to my reading notes repository.  My name is David Stokes. I am a student at Code Fellows. I am originally from NJ but currently live in PA. I look forward to a career in software development and coding. So, far the journey with Code Fellows has been challenging, but worth it, when you see the new things that you create.
