## About Me

Hi. Welcome to my reading notes repository.  My name is David Stokes. I am a student at Code Fellows. I am originally from NJ but currently live in PA. I look forward to a career in software development and coding. So, far the journey with Code Fellows has been challenging, but worth it, when you see the new things that you create. In my spare time, I am currently self-studying a foreign language. I am not conversational yet, but I feel I am very close, I just have to keep at it and not give up. 

# The Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is the continuous effort of improving yourself, by embracing and trying to solve challenges and hardships that come your way, despite whatever short term discomfort it may cause. In our modern day society there are many people who want what is known as instant gratification. Steve Haffenden mentioned this in his article by saying:
>*It's the idea that we'll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions.*

In order to keep to yourself focused and in the growth mindset you should constantly be reminding yourself that:
 1. Whenever a difficult task lay ahead, you must not give into your impulses of immediate gratifiation, by procrastinating and avoiding getting the task done, because keep in mind, that you will feel guilty about it later, knowing that you avoided getting something done that you should have completed. 
 2. Instead of Ignoring constructive cristicism or taking it personally by being insulted by it, use it as feedback for what you are doing well and where you need to improve. 
 3. As Steve said in his article, you should be assessing yourself at the end of each day, to go over what you have accomplished, what went good during the day, what went wrong, and making sure that whatever you did wrong during the day doesn't happen again.
