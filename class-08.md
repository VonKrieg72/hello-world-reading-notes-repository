# Layout

Within CSS, there is the **containing or parent element,** which is when one block level element sits inside of another one. It’s common within HTML, for these block level elements to be grouped together within the  < div > element. Web browsers will treat and display HTML in a default way, which is known as **Normal Flow,** which will show your webpage in a static position. Within this layout, each block level element is placed on top of the next one. With **Relative Positioning,** you have the ability to move elements in relation to where they would be in a normal flow. For example, you are able to move block level elements 5 pixels lower and 15 percent to the left, as opposed to what it would be in a normal flow. There are also options that you have with positioning, which enable you to do things. With **Absolute Positioning** the box is taken out or removed, and as a result, its affect on the position of the other elements on the page, no longer applies. With **Fixed Positioning** the value of the positioning property must be fixed, which makes it very similar to absolute positioning. The **Float Element** enables you to take an element in normal flow, and place it to either the right or left side as far as you would like. With the use of **Fixed Width Layouts,** your control over the appearance and position of items on the page increases significantly, unlike liquid layouts; however, you can end up with big gaps around the edges of the page. If you use **Liquid Layouts** your pages will expand to fill the entire browser window, so that there are no spaces around the page; however, if you don’t have control over the width of sections of the page, then the design has the possibility of looking much more different than you intended, with unexpected gaps around certain elements, or items can appear squashed together as well. 

Most web designers will try to create web pages at 960-1000 pixels wide, because that’s the size that most users will be able to see. The **960 Pixel Grid** is widely used by web designers, because on some websites they enable the designer to display thick vertical lines, which are super imposed over the top of a website, to show the user how the page was designed according to a grid. With these grids the web designer is able to set consistently proportions and spaces between items. This helps in creating a very professional design look. **CSS Frameworks** enable the web designer use a provided code to accomplish common tasks, which gives the web designer the ability to create grid layouts, style forms, and create printer friendly version of pages. CSS Frameworks save you time by not making it necessary to write code for the same tasks.*(Duckett, Jon, HTML & CSS: design and build websites, pp. 362-395 2011.)*
